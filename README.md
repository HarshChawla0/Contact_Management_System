# Contact Management System

The Contact Management System helps to store the different details 
of the contacts like name, mobile no, address and their E-mail ID. 

Different functions user can perform are:

* Create a new contact
* Delete an existing contact   
* Search for a contact
* Edit a contact
* List all the contacts

Many concepts of C language have been used to make this system:

* Control Statements
* Arrays
* Pointers
* Structure
* User - defined Functions
* File Handling
